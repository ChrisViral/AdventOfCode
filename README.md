# Advent of Code
I'll be uploading my solutions to the Advent of Code challenges in this repository. The solutions try to be as much as possible using only the standard libraries from each language I'm using, but if absolutely needed I'll include an external library but give a reference to it.

My solutions are meant to work while being as clear as possible. Speed, efficiency, and algorithmic complexity are not my first concern, as long as it doesn't make it stupidly slow. Some answers might be naive ways to deal with certain problems, but they'd also be the simpler way in this case, and this is what I'm going for. This challenge isn't really the place to push the limits of performance really.
